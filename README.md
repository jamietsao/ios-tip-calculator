# A Simple iOS Tip Calculator

This is a tip calculator I built in Swift as part of the application process for an iOS bootcamp by [CodePath](http://codepath.com).  This is my first iOS app - I had zero knowledge of Objective-C/Swift prior to starting this.

Time spent: ~6 hours

Completed user stories:
